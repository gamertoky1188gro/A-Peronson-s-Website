// One-time migration: the support evidence namespace.
//
// A support case's evidence used to be written into the ROOT of
// server/uploads, which the static mount serves unauthenticated, and the row
// that described it carried entity_type "support_ticket" — a type the
// authorization resolver has no branch for, so it fell into the hard-deny
// default. This script moves the bytes into the gated /uploads/support
// prefix and re-points the rows at it.
//
// The rules this script follows, in order of importance:
//
//   1. It NEVER deletes a file it cannot move. An unmovable file is left
//      exactly where it is and reported; the row is left alone too, because
//      a row that points at a file that is not there is a row that
//      authorizes nothing.
//   2. It never overwrites an existing file. A name that is already taken
//      gets a suffix rather than the bytes being clobbered.
//   3. It only touches rows whose entity_type is a support one. Every other
//      document — verification documents, payment proofs, feed media — is
//      left exactly as it is.
//
// The entity_type is normalised to "support_case" in the same pass, because
// the resolver has exactly one branch for the namespace and an unrecognised
// type is a hard deny: a file moved into the gated prefix but left under the
// old type would be unreachable for everyone, the uploader included.
//
// --- the --dry-run flag ----------------------------------------------------
//
// `--dry-run` prints the plan and changes NOTHING: no file is moved, no row
// is retyped, no row is deleted, and the target directory is not even
// created. It reads the rows and stats the files, which is the only way to
// know what the real run would do.
//
// The flag matters because of WHERE the script has to run. It resolves its
// paths from `process.cwd()`, so it must be run on the host that actually
// holds the served files: run from a laptop against a production database it
// reports every row unmovable, moves nothing, and raises no error — which
// looks exactly like a successful no-op. See
// docs/rollout/2026-10-20-support-attachment-migration.md.
