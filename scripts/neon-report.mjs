/**
 * NEON TEST LAB — aggregate reporting workflow (`npm run test:report`).
 *
 * 1. Clears ONLY the dedicated generated-result dirs (never source, never /).
 * 2. Runs the full Jest suite (Allure results via allure-jest env + JSON + coverage).
 * 3. Runs the Playwright suite (HTML + JSON + Allure results, single execution).
 * 4. Generates + finalizes the aggregated Allure report.
 * 5. Builds the Neon hub data file.
 *
 * Exit status: 0 only if every executed test passed AND every artifact was
 * produced. A report is still generated from partial results on failure, but
 * the command reports failure — a red suite can never look green.
