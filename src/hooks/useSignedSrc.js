/**
 * Signs a gated asset path and reports what happened.
 *
 * "" is the fail-closed value: callers render nothing rather than the raw path,
 * so an unsigned private url can never reach a DOM sink. That also means a
 * public (non-gated) path renders nothing too — the server reports `not_gated`
 * and issues no url — so use this only for gated assets (chat attachments,
 * contract artifacts, call recordings).
 *
 * The `error` half exists because a failed sign and a pending sign are not the
 * same thing. A pending sign is a blank space the user is about to see filled
 * in; a failed sign is a preview that is NOT going to arrive, and if the
 * surface cannot tell the two apart it renders nothing and says nothing, and
 * the user is left looking at a hole where a file should be. A rate-limited
 * sign in particular used to be indistinguishable from a refused one.
 *
 * @param {string} url - Asset path, relative or absolute. Falsy disables signing.
 * @param {{ refreshMs?: number | null }} [options] - `refreshMs` re-signs on an
 *   interval so a surface the user leaves open past the signature's ttl keeps
 *   working. `null` (the default) means "half the lifetime the SERVER gave the
 *   signature" — the server is the authority on how long a signature lasts, and
 *   a client-side copy of that number drifts the moment the server changes it.
 *   Pass 0 for short-lived decorative thumbnails: every refresh swaps the
 *   element's src, which visibly reloads an <img> and restarts a <video>, so it
 *   is only worth paying for on interactive surfaces.
 * @returns {{ src: string, error: { reason: string, status: number | null } | null }}
 *   The signed url ("" until the server hands one back) and the reason the
 *   sign failed, or null while it is pending or after it succeeded.
