// Client half of the signed-URL gate built in server/utils/signedFileUrl.js.
//
// A signed url is a bearer credential in the query string: it is valid for five
// minutes by default (fifteen for call recordings) and it is the only thing
// `/api/files/content` accepts, because that route deliberately sits outside
// requireAuth so an <img>, an <iframe> and a new tab can all reach it without
// attaching an Authorization header.
//
// Three consequences shape everything below:
//
//   1. Sign immediately before you navigate or render. A url captured at mount
//      and reused across renders has already expired by the time anyone clicks.
//      Callers sign in the click handler (signAndOpen / signAndDownload), in a
//      one-shot ahead of a fetch (signOne), or in an effect keyed on the
//      attachment (signAndAssign / useSignedSrc).
//   2. Normalise first. Callers hold absolute urls whenever VITE_API_URL is set,
//      but the server's path helpers only strip a leading "uploads/", so an
//      absolute url arrives as the first segment "http:" and is reported
//      not_gated. Every entry point therefore reduces to a pathname before it
//      is sent.
//   3. Fail closed. A refused path, a network error, a 503 from an unconfigured
//      signing secret — all of them mean there is no url to use, and the helpers
//      return false / null rather than handing back the unsigned path. Nothing
//      here ever falls back to the raw path, because that fallback is the leak
//      the server-side gate exists to prevent.
//
// There is deliberately NO client-side copy of the server's gated-prefix list.
// The client used to keep one, to decide whether a document could be handed to
// the Office viewer — a live signature is a credential, so a private document
// must never reach view.officeapps.live.com. A second copy of that list is a
// drift hazard with a third-party consequence: a prefix added to the server
// without updating the copy left the embed unsuppressed and handed a private
// document's signed url to Microsoft, which fetches and retains it. The server
// now answers the question instead (thirdPartySafe on every /sign entry), and
// the client asks. The same goes for the signature lifetime: the server
// returns the ttl it actually used, instead of the client mirroring a
// constant that drifts the moment the server changes it.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// REQUESTS ARE BATCHED
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// The client used to ask the server for ONE PATH PER REQUEST. That does not
// survive a per-user budget: a chat thread with fifty images is fifty
// requests, and a preview modal spends another one asking whether the document
// may be handed to a third party. The server accepts up to 50 paths in a
// single request, and the paths a client wants at the same moment are exactly
// the paths of one render, so they go together.
//
// The batch is flushed on the next microtask: every caller that asks during
// the same turn lands in the same request, and a request never carries more
// than the server's own per-request cap.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// A RATE LIMIT IS NOT A SILENT MISS
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// The server answers 429 when the caller has spent its budget, and it answers
// 403 when the caller may not see the file. Those are different facts and the
// user has to be able to tell them apart: a thumbnail that did not appear
// because the server is busy looks exactly like a thumbnail that did not
// appear because the user is not allowed to see it. The old code swallowed
// every failure into an empty object, so the surface could not tell, and the
// preview simply did not render.
//
// So a 429 is reported (SIGN_RATE_LIMITED), the client backs off before the
// next request, and the surfaces turn it into a message.

// server/routes/fileAccessRoutes.js slices the body to MAX_PATHS_PER_REQUEST.
// Matching the cap here keeps the client from sending a request the server
// would silently answer for a prefix of the list.
const MAX_PATHS_PER_SIGN = 50;

// a permission verdict: a 429 is about the CALLER's request rate, not about
// the file.
