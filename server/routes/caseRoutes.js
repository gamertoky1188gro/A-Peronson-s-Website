// Every route is behind requireAuth: the case API is private to signed-in
// callers, and the ownership rule (the case's own owner, or an owner/admin
// role) is enforced inside the controller, where the case row is read.
//
// The routes are ALSO behind a per-user rate limiter. The limiter has to
// count the USER, not the address: many users share one address behind a
// NAT, and one address behind many users is not a user. A case is not a
// cheap request - it can spawn an opencode process, write five database
// rows, mail every owner and admin and raise a staff notification - so the
// number of them one caller may ask for is bounded.
//
// The key is namespaced (`support-case:` / `support-case-write:`) on
// purpose: the in-memory limiter keys its counter by the resolved key and
// ignores the `prefix` option, so two limiters that resolved the same key
// would SHARE one counter and the smaller budget would silently become the
// budget for both.
