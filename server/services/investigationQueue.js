/**
 * The investigation queue.
 *
 * One support case is one job. The job starts a read-only opencode runtime,
 * gives every agent role its OWN session, runs the prompts, and writes one
 * `SupportInvestigation` row per role. The `verify` role runs LAST, over the
 * findings the specialists produced, and its verdict is applied to them.
 *
 * Three invariants are the point of this file:
 *
 *  - ONE SESSION PER ROLE. The model's own `task` delegation is denied by the
 *    runtime configuration precisely because it is a privilege-escalation path
 *    (contracts.md §6), so the queue never uses it. Each role gets its own
 *    session and the queue itself is the only thing that fans out.
 *
 *  - A PER-RUN RANDOM PASSWORD. The runtime listens on 127.0.0.1 and is
 *    authenticated with HTTP basic auth. The password is minted per run from
 *    the CSPRNG: never a constant, never reused between runs, never logged.
 *
 *  - THE RUNTIME IS ALWAYS STOPPED. The `finally` block removes the sessions
 *    and stops the runtime, whether the run succeeded, failed to parse, or
 *    threw on the way.
 *
 * The depth is the number of investigations that have been enqueued and have
 * not finished yet - waiting plus running. The media queues report the
 * waiting count only, but a media job takes seconds and an investigation
 * takes minutes: a waiting-only depth would report zero while two
 * investigations were each holding a spawned runtime.
 *
 * What lands in the database, and who reads it:
 *
 *  - The four specialist rows (`lead`, `code`, `repo`, `research`) hold the
 *    findings that role produced, with the confidence each finding carries
 *    AFTER the verification pass was applied.
 *  - The `verify` row holds the FINAL set of findings - every specialist
 *    finding, with the verification applied - together with the verifier's
 *    own summary and limitations. The report builder (Task 6) reads the
 *    verify row for the final set and the specialist rows for the per-agent
 *    log.
 *  - A role whose reply could not be parsed is recorded as `failed`, with
 *    the raw answer in `error`, and contributes NO findings. A failed parse
 *    never becomes an empty-but-successful result.
