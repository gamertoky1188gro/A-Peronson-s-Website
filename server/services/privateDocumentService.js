// facts the authorization needs — who uploaded the file, which thread it went
// to, which call session owns the recording — only exist at the moment the
// file lands on disk. A backfill can never know them: the AI-moderation
// backfill (uploadsService) is disabled in the deployed configuration
// (AI_HARAM_ANALYTICS_ENABLED=false) and it only ever covered image/video.
//
// A file without a row is not "public" — it is unreachable, for everyone,
// including the person who uploaded it. That is the fail-closed direction, and
// it is why the row is written on the upload path rather than by a scanner.

 * Writes the Document row that anchors one private upload.

 * @param {Object} params

 *   owning case id for a support attachment.
 * @param {string} params.filePath The public path, e.g. "/uploads/chat/x.png".
 * @param {string} params.uploadedBy The id of the user who uploaded it.
 * @param {string} [params.type] The media type, for the admin listing.
 * @param {Object} [params.moderation] Optional moderation columns for the
 *   admin review queue: { moderation_status, moderation_flags }. Absent for
 *   the three callers that have no moderation step.
 * @returns {Promise<Object|null>} The created row, or null when it could not
