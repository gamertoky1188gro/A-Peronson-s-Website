/**
 * Reading an opencode v2 assistant turn.
 *
 * The v2 API answers `session.prompt` asynchronously: it returns as soon as the
 * user message is queued, and the assistant's turn has to be polled for.
 *
 * Two facts about the v2 message list are easy to get wrong, and both of them
 * have broken this codebase before:
 *
 *  - The list is ordered NEWEST FIRST. `messages[messages.length - 1]` is the
 *    message that opened the session, not the one that answered the question.
 *    Picking the last element therefore answers with the PREVIOUS turn's
 *    reply, and it settles the poll early because that stale message already
 *    carries `finish: "stop"`.
 *  - A tool call's state moves streaming -> running -> completed without the
 *    content array changing size, so "the content stopped growing" is not a
 *    settle signal.
 *
 * This module has no dependencies on purpose: it is imported by the server
 * service and by the unit tests, and it has to be importable without a
 * database, a model provider or a network.
