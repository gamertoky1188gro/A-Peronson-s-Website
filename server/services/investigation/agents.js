/**
 * The five read-only investigation agents, their prompts, and the verification
 * helpers.
 *
 * Every agent is the same machine with a different question. The runtime gives
 * each one its own session (contracts.md §6, one session per role, never the
 * model's own `task` delegation); this file gives each one a prompt that names
 * the question, the case, the evidence, and the shape of the answer.
 *
 * Two invariants live here, and both are load-bearing:
 *
 *  - A prompt never asks for something the runtime denies the agent. The
 *    runtime configuration (server/services/investigation/runtimeConfig.js)
 *    denies `edit`, `bash`, `webfetch`, `websearch`, `question` and `task`, so
 *    a prompt that asks for "the git log" or "the upstream issue" is asking
 *    for something the agent cannot do, and whatever it invents instead is
 *    worse than an honest limitation. Every prompt therefore asks only for
 *    what the read tools can produce, and says so in `limitations` when the
 *    rest is out of reach.
 *  - A claim without evidence cannot survive the pipeline. `applyVerification`
 *    demotes a refuted finding, and demotes any finding with an empty evidence
 *    array, whatever the verifier said about it.
 *
 *  - The CLIENT'S TEXT IS DATA, NOT INSTRUCTION. The description and the
 *    evidence reach the prompt verbatim, so they are fenced in
 *    `<untrusted_client_input>` tags and the rules that go with them say so
 *    plainly. The same rules forbid reproducing a secret the repository
 *    holds: the investigator names the file and the line, never the value.

/**
 * How many tool calls an agent may spend before it has to answer.

 * make 67 read-only tool calls in ten minutes and still going when the clock
 * ran out - so the turn was cut off before it ever wrote its answer, and all
 * that work was lost. A budget turns the search into a finite one: the agent
