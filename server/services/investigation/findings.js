/**
 * Findings parsing, normalisation and demotion.
 *
 * An investigation agent is a language model, so its "JSON" arrives as prose
 * with a JSON object somewhere inside it, and its fields arrive with the
 * wrong type about as often as not. This module is the boundary that turns
 * that into the fixed `Finding` shape of contracts.md §5:
 *
 *   { confidence: "confirmed | probable | speculative",
 *     detail: "string",
 *     evidence: [ { file, lines, commit, url } ] }
 *
 * Three invariants, and they are the point of the module:
 *
 *  1. `parseAgentJson` NEVER THROWS. A model that answers with an apology
 *     instead of JSON is an expected outcome, not an exception, and a thrown
 *     error inside the investigation queue would take down the run that was
 *     otherwise fine.
 *  2. `normalizeFindings` NEVER emits an undefined field. Every finding it
 *     returns has all three keys, and `evidence` is always an array - even
 *     an empty one. A `findings` column holding `undefined` is how a report
 *     ends up with a hole in it.
 *  3. There is NO PATH THAT PROMOTES AN UNEVIDENCED CLAIM. A finding with an
 *     empty `evidence` array is `speculative`, and `demoteUnsubstantiated`
 *     makes that true of a list that arrives from anywhere else.
