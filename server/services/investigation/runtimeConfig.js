/**
 * Read-only opencode configuration for the AI support investigation portal.
 *
 * The read-only lever is the SINGULAR `permission` key, in object syntax, keyed
 * by tool name. Wildcards apply to the tool's input; the last matching rule wins.
 *
 * Two traps this file exists to avoid (both verified live against opencode v2):
 *  - The array form `permissions: [{ action, resource, effect }]` is silently
 *    ignored by opencode v2 and FAILS OPEN. Never convert this to that shape.
 *  - `task` (subagent delegation) is a privilege-escalation path: with no write
 *    tool of its own, an investigator can delegate the write to a subagent.
 *    `task: "deny"` is therefore mandatory, not optional.

 * An ARRAY OF SOURCES is also accepted, and is how the agent's own permission
