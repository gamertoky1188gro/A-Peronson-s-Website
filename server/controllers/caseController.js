/**
 * GET /api/support/cases/:caseId/stream — the case's live event stream.
 *
 * Server-Sent Events. The client subscribes with a plain `fetch`, not an
 * EventSource, because an EventSource cannot carry the Authorization header
 * this server requires — and a token in a query string would put a credential
 * in a URL.
 *
 * The wire format is contracts.md §4's, unchanged:
 *
 *   event: support.case.message
 *   data: {"caseId":"<case id>","message":{...}}
 *
 * So every frame names one of the five fixed event types and carries a JSON
 * envelope that ALWAYS carries the case id. The envelope is flat: the
 * payload's own keys sit next to `caseId` rather than inside a nested
 * `payload` object, exactly as contracts.md §4 writes it.
 *
 * The stream is case-scoped. The bus is shared by every case, so an event
 * for another case is dropped instead of forwarded, and the case id in the
 * envelope is the one this stream is for.
 *
 * @param {Object} req
 * @param {Object} res
