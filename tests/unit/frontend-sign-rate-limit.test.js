/**
 * The client's side of the /sign budget (src/lib/signedFile.js).
 *
 * Two things were wrong:
 *
 *   1. The client asked the server for ONE PATH PER REQUEST. A chat thread
 *      with fifty images was fifty requests against a per-user budget of
 *      sixty a minute, and every preview modal spent another one. The server
 *      accepts up to 50 paths in a single request, so the paths a client wants
 *      at the same moment now go together.
 *
 *   2. A 429 was swallowed. `signPaths` caught every failure and returned an
 *      empty object, so a rate-limited sign and a refused sign were
 *      indistinguishable: the thumbnail or the download simply did not
 *      appear, with nothing on screen to say why and no backoff to let the
 *      server recover.
 *
 * This file is separate from tests/unit/frontend-signed-file.test.js on
 * purpose: the rate-limit cooldown is module state, so a 429 in one test
 * would slow every later sign request in the same file. One file, one
 * module registry, one cooldown.
