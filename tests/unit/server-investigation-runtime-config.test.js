		/**
		 * THE GATE. An agent permission block is acceptable only if it is
		 * restrictive. Three rules, each asserted on its own so a failure says
		 * WHICH rule was broken:
		 *
		 *  1. it contains no "allow" at any depth - a nested object is a
		 *     resource-scoped rule set and its leaves are effects too;
		 *  2. composed with the global map, every mutating action is still
		 *     denied on every swept resource;
		 *  3. composed with the global map, a denied read is STILL denied.
		 *
		 * Rule 3 is "deny" VERBATIM, the same treatment rule 2 gives a
		 * mutating action, and NOT "not allow".
		 *
		 * The reason is that "ask" is not a neutral middle ground on the read
		 * side. opencode v2's own default is `read *.env -> ask`, so the
		 * explicit "deny" this config carries is a deliberate STRENGTHENING
		 * of the default. A rule that accepted "ask" would permit weakening
		 * that denial back to the default - a hard deny silently downgraded
		 * to a prompt - and upstream has reports of an "ask" being
		 * auto-approved in some configurations (anomalyco/opencode issues
		 * #55593 and #54790). A denial that can be turned into a prompt is
		 * not a denial, so the composed effect on a sensitive resource has to
		 * be exactly "deny".
