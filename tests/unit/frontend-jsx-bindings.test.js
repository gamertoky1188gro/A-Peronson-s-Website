/**
 * Guards the signed-URL surfaces against a JSX element name that has no binding.
 *
 * Context: 31a075d swapped two RightPanel call sites to <SignedImage> and
 * deleted the LazyImage import in the same edit, but a third call site — the
 * activeAvatar in the thread header — still used it. Nothing caught it:
 *
 *   - Biome's noUndeclaredVariables is effectively inert here (it cannot resolve
 *     a JSX element name against an import), so `biome check` passed.
 *   - No test renders RightPanel.
 *   - Rollup treats an unresolved *identifier* as a global and does not even
 *     warn; the build printed "built" and exited 0 with the bug present.
 *   - The whole unit suite was green.
 *
 * Rendering these components is not an option: RightPanel alone needs a large
 * mock surface, which is not proportionate to a one-line fix. So this asserts
 * statically, by parsing.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHAT THIS DOES NOT CATCH  (every behavioural bullet below is asserted by a
 * test, so a change in behaviour breaks the suite instead of silently
 * outrunning this comment)
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * 1. Identifiers used OUTSIDE a JSX tag. The scan only ever looks at
 *    JSXOpeningElement names. The incident was a missing binding on a JSX tag,
 *    which this does catch; the same mistake in an expression body — a bare
 *    `LazyImage` passed to a function, assigned to a variable — is invisible to
 *    it. That is half the failure class the guard is named after, and it is
 *    not covered. Asserted by "ignores identifiers used outside a JSX tag".
 *
 * 2. Bindings that exist at runtime but not in the lexical scope: a component
 *    installed onto `globalThis`, one created by `eval`, or a name produced by
 *    a macro. Those are reported as unbound — false positives, not false
 *    negatives. Asserted by "reports a name bound only inside a narrower scope".
 *
 * 3. A `require` performed inside a block (`if (x) { const A = require(...) }`)
 *    binds `A` in that block only, so a JSX use outside the block is reported.
 *    Same test as (2). A *conditional require at module top level* is fine and
 *    is not reported — only block-scoped ones are.
 *
 * 4. Files with no JSX at all, which cannot be inspected by a JSX-element
 *    guard. `src/hooks/useSignedSrc.js` (a hook) and `src/lib/signedFile.js`
 *    are therefore NOT in GUARDED below. An earlier revision listed
 *    useSignedSrc.js and had its probe test pass on a file where no probe was
 *    ever injected — a green test for work that never happened, which is the
 *    precise failure this guard exists to prevent.
 *
 * 5. Anything outside the five guarded files. The repo-wide
 *    `noUndeclaredVariables` / tsconfig migration remains deferred.
 *
 * HISTORY — why this parses instead of pattern-matching source text. The first
 * version blanked comments *and* strings with a regex before scanning for
 * `<Name`; an apostrophe in JSX text ("This can't be loaded") shifted the
 * string-pairing parity and blanked every later JSX tag. Measured on the
 * guarded files that destroyed 11 of 18 tags in ChatInterface and *all* of
 * them in AttachmentPreviewModal and FileAttachmentCard — so the guard passed
 * those three vacuously while a real unbound element sat in them. Parsing has
 * no such failure mode.

/**
 * Capitalised JSX element names with no *lexical* binding anywhere in scope.
 *
 * The narrowing is `getBinding`, not `hasBinding`, and the reason is not the
 * `{ noGlobals: true }` argument: `Scope#getBinding(name)` takes ONE
 * parameter and ignores the second one. The narrowing works because
 * `getBinding` never consults the runtime's globals - it walks the lexical
 * scopes only - so a name the runtime provides comes back *unbound* and is
 * reported. `scope.hasBinding(name)` does consult the globals, so with
 * hasBinding alone `<Map />`, `<Error />`, `<Promise />`, `<Math />` and 23
 * other globals came back "bound" and escaped.
 *
 * Measured over the 32 capitalised globals in GLOBAL_PROBE_NAMES: with
 * getBinding, 32 are flagged and 0 escape; with hasBinding alone, 5 are
 * flagged and 27 escape. Every name that escapes is a plausible typo target -
 * a deleted import called `Map` is exactly as broken as one called
 * `LazyImage`. Asserted by "flags a JSX name that resolves only to a runtime
 * global" and by "measures the global-name escape rate".
 *
 * The cost of the narrowing is caveat 2/3 in the header: names that exist only
 * at runtime are now reported instead of silently accepted. That is the right
 * direction to fail for a guard whose entire job is a loud ReferenceError.
