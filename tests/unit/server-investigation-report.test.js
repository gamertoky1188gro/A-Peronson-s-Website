// The report renderer is the artefact the owner reads instead of the
// conversation: every agent that ran, every finding it produced, the
// evidence behind that finding, what nobody could establish, and what
// should happen next.
//
// The honesty half is the one that can break silently. A failed
// investigation is NOT a clean result. If the renderer treats "the agent
// died" as "the agent found nothing", the report tells the owner the
// system looked and there was nothing there — a claim the owner will act
// on. These tests pin the difference.
//
// The interface is fixed by the workstream brief:
//
//   buildReport({ caseRow, messages, investigations }) -> string (Markdown)
//
// and the shapes it consumes are fixed by contracts.md §5:
//   SupportInvestigation.findings  -> { summary, findings[], limitations[] }
//   SupportInvestigation.evidence  -> { files[], commits[], queries[], failures[] }
//   SupportInvestigation.tool_log  -> [{ tool, status, error? }]
//   a finding                      -> { confidence, detail, evidence[] }
